He’s been seen doing everything with his dominant right hand, from signing autographs to playing guitar.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about the multi-talented legend that is Jack Black.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He’s Tenacious</h2><p>Jack Black had to work considerably hard to reach the level he would become known for. His humor, acting skill, and musical talent wouldn’t shine through properly until the early 2000s. However, he’d been trying to break into the entertainment industry since 1982.</p><p>His first appearance was in a commercial when he was aged just thirteen. From that point on, Jack Black – full name Thomas Jacob Black – set his sights on acting for a living. However, he wasn’t traditionally handsome and didn’t command much of a stage presence. His parents were satellite engineers, not performers.&nbsp;</p><p>While he performed very well in his dramatic studies in school, <a href=# rel=noopener>he fell short elsewhere</a>. This lack of success would follow him around, it wouldn’t be until 2000, nearly two decades after he started acting, that he’d hit a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p><p>He co-starred in a successful John Cusack movie and was propelled into the spotlight. Over the next few years, he found himself getting cast in lead roles. This hadn’t ever happened before, and the offers came thick and fast.&nbsp;</p><p>He appeared in Shallow Hal, Year One, Nacho Libre, and School of Rock. Many of his movies were commercial successes, earning him a credible slot in Hollywood. His humor and musical talent shone through in many of his films, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>His tenacity and determination had paid off. Within a few short years, Black would find himself appearing as the lead in a Disney Pixar production. This production – Kung Fu Panda – was arguably one of Black’s most prolific roles, and would <a href=# rel=noopener>ultimately spawn a quadrilogy of movies</a>.</p><p>Jack Black would come to work with some of the industry’s biggest names. Some of these would include Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr., and Will Ferrell.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Multi-Talented Man</h2><p>As we’ve explained, Jack Black wasn’t just an accomplished actor. He’d also enjoyed a lengthy career as a musician. His primary musical role is as one half of a comedy rock duo, Tenacious D. The pair joined forces in 1994, and found huge success as artists.</p><p>Black himself brings lead vocals and rhythm guitar to the band. His performing partner, Kyle Gass, is the lead guitarist for the band. That point circles back to our original question. As Jack Black is right-hand dominant, he plays guitar the way the vast majority do – with his right hand. You can see a video of him below playing guitar on a talk show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Although left-handed people make up a clear minority of the human race, they are out there. There have been many famous musicians and performers that <a href=# rel=noopener>played with their left hand</a>. For instance, Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix – they both played left-handed guitars.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example of right-hand dominant dexterity came in a 2020 video. Jack Black uploaded a short clip, wherein he was giving himself a haircut. <a href=# rel=noopener>Throughout this video</a>, he’s using his right hand to operate scissors and hair clippers.</p><p>Jack Black has also tried to modernize his acting talents. At the end of 2018, he launched a YouTube channel called JablinskiGames. The channel was a huge success, and within the first week alone gathered a huge following of one million subscribers. As of 2020, this number was approaching the five million mark.</p><p>He’s uploaded many videos, most of which are vlogs that offer insight into his personal and family lives. There have also been gaming videos uploaded to the channel, and Jack himself has taken part in video game streaming sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it was a long journey, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jack Black</a> did finally find the success he was searching for. As of 2020, he’d received nominations for two Golden Globes, and had won a Grammy with Tenacious D. He’d even been inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame.&nbsp;</p><p>He boasted an approximate net worth of <a href=# rel=noopener>$40 million in 2020</a> and was living comfortably. His ventures showed no sign of stopping, and he was setting up to star in more productions, even as the years wore on.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqKRmLhursuamqRlop60qcCMqKlmpJWbwW60wKebnpxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html&text=Is%20Jack%20Black%20Right%20Or%20Left-Handed%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html&title=Is%20Jack%20Black%20Right%20Or%20Left-Handed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html&title=Is%20Jack%20Black%20Right%20Or%20Left-Handed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html&title=Is%20Jack%20Black%20Right%20Or%20Left-Handed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jack-black-right-or-left-handed.html&description=Is%20Jack%20Black%20Right%20Or%20Left-Handed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kaylee-stoermer-coleman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaylee Stoermer Coleman: Zendayas Youngest Sister and Her Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tremendously-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Tremendously>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
