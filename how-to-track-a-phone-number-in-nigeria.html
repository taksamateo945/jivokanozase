Losing your phone can be distressing, but, even if you aren’t tech-savvy, you can still salvage the situation if you’re well-prepared for such circumstances and respond quickly enough. In this article, you will get to know the many methods you can use to track a phone in Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>How to Track a Phone Number in Nigeria</strong></h2><p>Phone tracking helps you to identify the exact location of criminals and apprehend them and there are a few different ways to track a phone number in Nigeria. Some of the most known methods are:</p><ul><li><strong>Using a tracking app:</strong> There are a number of these apps available and they all work in pretty much the same way. You enter the phone number you want to track and the app will show you its location on a map. An app like Truecaller is a cell phone tracker that most Nigerians know and use to track phone numbers. It’s a caller identification app that allows users to track someone with their phone number. This application is free, and you can use it to track a caller’s location.</li><li><strong>Contacting your network service provider: </strong>They may be able to help you track the number if they have records of where it’s been used</li><li><strong>Using a reverse lookup service:</strong> These services work by extracting information from public databases about phone numbers and their owners.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Track a Stolen Phone</strong></h2><p>When your phone is stolen, there are chances that you could recover it and save all important personal information, passwords, bank and financial details you wouldn’t want someone else to have access to.

With these in hand, these two major steps could be helpful in tracking a stolen phone.</p><h3><strong>Track stolen phone using the find my phone feature on your Phone</strong></h3><p>One of the first options you will like to take to track your stolen phone is to use the find my phone feature.
