And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people‚Ä¶because there is no fixing this,‚Äù Adams ranted.</p><p>The poll in question was conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a conservative-leaning polling group. The poll criticized ‚Äúwoke‚Äù culture, a political talking point, especially among conservatives criticizing social justice efforts. The poll suggested 26 percent of Black Americans disagreed with the statement ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ok to be white,‚Äù and 21 percent were not sure.</p><p>Adams, who once claimed to identify as Black, quipped in response, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to re-identify as white because I don‚Äôt want to identify as a hate group.‚Äù</p><p>Adams went on to reference CNN anchor Don Lemon to leverage personal commentary that claimed predominately ‚ÄúBlack neighborhoods had more problems than white neighborhoods.‚Äù</p><p>Adams further espouse his efforts to help the Black community although he did not provide specific examples in his monologue. He then implied Black Americans do not value education as much as white people.</p><p>‚ÄúEverybody who focuses their priority on education does well, if anybody in the Black community focuses on education, they‚Äôll do well as well because the system allows that. If they don‚Äôt, I just can‚Äôt make that my problem anymore‚Äù Adams said.</p><p>The cartoonist also claimed he was ‚Äúsick of seeing video after video of Black Americans beating up non-Black citizens.‚Äù</p><p>In the days that followed, reaction was swift to condemn Adams‚Äô comments.</p><p>‚ÄúHe should just grab up his boys and head to some remote island where they can love on each other and not have to see us,‚Äù wrote <a href=#>fwilk51</a>3 on Atlanta Black Star‚Äôs Instagram page.</p><p>Fellow Instagram user, KellyKalz simply asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused we‚Äôre ‚ÄòThe Hate Group‚Äô.</p><p>‚ÄúShidd.

The comic features the Dilbert character that portrays an office manager typically mocking office culture through satire. The cartoon ran in newspapers across the country and internationally. The comic strip was later turned into a cartoon in the late 1990s.</p><p>Adams‚Äô net worth is an estimated $75 million, but after his viral rant, he admits that could soon change.</p><p>‚ÄúMost of my income will be gone by next week,‚Äù Adams said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>White people in the media are also the main source of worsening race relations.</p>‚Äî Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>An obvious question for those who canceled me is do they disagree with my point.
