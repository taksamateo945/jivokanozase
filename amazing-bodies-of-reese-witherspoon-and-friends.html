"Everyone has their own journey," she says. "I've struggled myself with, you know, eating disorders, and pressure to look a certain way.

"I wouldn't say I have a typical skincare routine as my routine definitely changes based on where I am (Nashville vs Sydney), what I'm doing (i.e; on-set or on vacation) and the weather.
