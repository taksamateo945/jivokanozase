As a central figure in the popular series <b>Game of Thrones</b>, Joffrey personifies cruelty and egotism, earning him the title of the most hated TV character of all time.</p><p>In Game of Thrones, <b>Joffrey Baratheon</b> is depicted as a tyrannical and sadistic ruler who delights in tormenting those around him. His actions, fueled by his unchecked power, have earned him the scorn and contempt of viewers everywhere. From his cowardly acts of violence to his complete disregard for the lives of others, Joffrey’s character leaves audiences seething with anger and frustration.</p><p>“Everyone is mine to torment.”</p><p>Joffrey’s reign of terror reaches its peak during pivotal moments in the show’s storyline, causing him to be universally despised not only by viewers but also by the other characters within the Game of Thrones universe.

But the hardest prey… is man.”</p><p>Ramsay’s reputation as a <b>despised character</b> stems not only from his heinous acts but also from the chilling manner in which he performed them. He reveled in the suffering of others and took pleasure in wielding power over those weaker than him. The combination of his sadistic behavior, coupled with his lack of empathy, made <b>Ramsay Bolton</b> a truly detested figure.</p><p>Despite his reign of terror on the small screen, Iwan Rheon’s portrayal of Ramsay Bolton was undeniably compelling. Rheon brought a chilling authenticity to the character, making viewers truly despise him. Such was the impact of Ramsay Bolton that even after the conclusion of Game of Thrones, his name continues to elicit a collective shudder from fans.</p><h2>Skyler White – Breaking Bad</h2><p><b>Skyler White</b>, played by Anna Gunn, holds the dubious honor of being the third most hated TV character in all of television. In the critically acclaimed series <b>Breaking Bad</b>, Skyler is not intended to be a villainous character, but her actions and behavior throughout the show rubbed many viewers the wrong way.

His unethical experimentation on his own family members and his shameless pride in his actions have made him the subject of intense hatred among viewers.</p><p></p><p>Shou Tucker’s character exemplifies the dark side of scientific pursuits and the moral implications that come with them. Known as the “Sewing-Life Alchemist,” Tucker uses alchemy to fuse living beings together, resulting in grotesque hybrid creatures known as chimeras. He believes that the progress of science justifies these horrific experiments, showing a complete lack of empathy and compassion.</p><p>The despicable nature of Shou Tucker’s actions is further accentuated by his lack of remorse. He takes perverse pleasure in his scientific achievements, proudly boasting about his grotesque creations to anyone who will listen. This arrogance and callousness only deepen the viewers’ disgust and further solidify Shou Tucker’s place on the list of <b>most hated TV characters</b>.</p><p>“The Sewing-Life Alchemist, huh? More like the Sewing-Death Alchemist…” – <b>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</b></p><p>Shou Tucker’s character serves as a cautionary tale about the ethical boundaries of scientific progress and the consequences of unchecked ambition.

In the epic series, Game of Thrones, Cersei is portrayed as a deceitful and elusive character, known for her cunning intelligence. She manipulates those around her to do her bidding, making her one of the most despised villains in the show.</p><p></p><p>Cersei’s conniving nature and her ability to outwit her enemies have made her a force to be reckoned with.

Portrayed by Jesse Plemons, Todd was ranked as the <b>seventh most hated TV character.</b></p><p>Todd’s villainous nature is evident through his actions in the series. He is known for his heinous acts, including imprisoning and torturing the main character, Jesse Pinkman, as well as brutally taking innocent lives without remorse.</p><p>“What makes Todd truly detestable is his lack of empathy and his chilling nonchalant demeanor while committing these atrocities,” said Breaking Bad fan John Smith. “He represents the darkest aspects of human nature.”</p><p>Todd’s character arc in Breaking Bad showcases the depths of his immorality. His manipulative and destructive nature adds an extra layer of tension and discomfort for viewers, making him one of the most despised characters in television history.</p><p></p><h2>Caillou</h2><p>In an unexpected twist, four-year-old <b>Caillou</b> was ranked as the eighth most disliked character by viewers.
