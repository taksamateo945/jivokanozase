She is also well known for walking the red carpet for Emily in Paris, as well as for other agencies and companies. In addition, she has amassed a sizable fan base on social media platforms such as TikTok, Youtube, and Instagram.</p><p>Madeleine White was born in England, United Kingdom, on November 8, 1995. Her nationality is British, and her zodiac sign is Scorpio. Despite being born in England, she was raised in the United States. Maddie completed her high school education at a local private school in her hometown. However, she has not attended college in order to pursue a modeling career. Meanwhile, White chose a career as a fashion model because she has always been interested in modeling and fashion. She is now known as a famous model.</p><p>White quickly became a household name in the modeling industry. Everyone was taken aback by her unique modeling style and attractive physique. Later, she began her modeling career by working for Calzedonia Official, Victoria's Secret, House Of CB, For Love & Lemons, and other fashion, sports, and apparel companies.&nbsp;So, if you are curious to know more about her current relationship status and wonder if she has a boyfriend, we are here to help!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>relationship status</strong></a>&nbsp;of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>iiTzTimmy</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Danny Brown</strong></a>.</p><h2>Madeleine White’s Boyfriend: The 27-Year-Old Model & Influencer Is Dating Andrew Fedyk, a Professional DJ!</h2><p>When it comes to <strong>Madeleine White</strong>'s relationship and past dating life, she prefers keeping her love lives and personal lives private. However, after conducting an extensive investigation into her Instagram, we discovered that Maddie (<a href=# rel=noopener>@madeleinecwhite</a>) is currently in a relationship with her boyfriend, <strong>Andrew Fedyk</strong>,&nbsp;who is a professional DJ.</p><p>White has been in a long-term relationship with Andrew with whom she frequently posts photos on her Instagram account. Andrew is a well-known social media personality, Instagram star, and DJ who began composing music in high school after seeing a <strong>Porter Robinson</strong> performance and decided to pursue it professionally.</p><p>Meanwhile, Andrew can be found on Instagram under the username (<a href=# rel=noopener>@andrewfedyk</a>), where he has over <strong>32.1k</strong> followers, <strong>989 </strong>followings, and <strong>242</strong> posts.

And with <strong>13 million</strong> views, Is She Giving Chic or Stuck in a Fishing Net dunno is one of the channel's most popular videos. Her other posts on various topics have also received millions of likes.</p><h2>Madeleine White Cut Her Prada Fashion Week Outfit and the Internet Quickly Reacted!</h2><p>The internet is divided this week over the model and influencer <strong>Madeleine White</strong>'s DIY tailoring of a head-to-toe Prada outfit she <a href=# rel=noopener>wore</a> to the brand's Fall/Winter 2023 runway show in Milan. White, who is known for her fashion videos in which she creatively customizes old items from her wardrobe, purchased a gray jumpsuit from the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 collection for <strong>$2,100</strong>.</p><p>While most people would treat a designer garment with care, White had other ideas. She took a pair of scissors and slashed the onesie down the center, transforming it into a tiny crop top and miniskirt à la <strong>Julia Fox</strong> (the Miu Miu set is shaking). White repurposed the legs of the jumpsuit as leg warmers, wasting no fabric.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>And to cut into a garment designed by <strong>Miuccia Prada</strong> and <strong>Raf Simons</strong> was certainly a bold move on White's part — and her decision to take scissors to brand-new Prada has elicited mixed reactions online. While some praise the influencer's DIY outfit, others criticize its raw edges, calling them messy and cheap-looking.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGikmpyVobKqusRmrqGhpJp6o7vYn6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html&text=The%20British%20Fashion%20Model%20Is%20Dating%20Andrew%20Fedyk%20In%202&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html&title=The%20British%20Fashion%20Model%20Is%20Dating%20Andrew%20Fedyk%20In%202" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html&title=The%20British%20Fashion%20Model%20Is%20Dating%20Andrew%20Fedyk%20In%202" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html&title=The%20British%20Fashion%20Model%20Is%20Dating%20Andrew%20Fedyk%20In%202" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmadeleine-white-boyfriend.html&description=The%20British%20Fashion%20Model%20Is%20Dating%20Andrew%20Fedyk%20In%202" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./half-a-quart-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Half a quart">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./2520207-bastian-schweinsteiger-transfer-news-latest-on-potential-manchester-united-move.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bastian Schweinsteiger Completes Transfer to Manchester United | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, an">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
